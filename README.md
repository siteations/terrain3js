# territory & terrain

This quick terrain editor allows users to load and build out lowpoly settlements. 
* Terrain colors (when turned on) reflect the slope of the underlying mesh triangulation. 
* Different settlement options (forests, cities, roads, boats) can only be placed on suitable slopes. 

It was developed with the three.js and html as a front-end application.
